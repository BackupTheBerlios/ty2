<U>What is Tyrant II ?</U><br><br>
Tyrant is a roguelike game in which you play a lone hero in a world of adventure and magic. You start your journeys near a small town, tasked with a mission to recover an ancient artifact known as The Emerald Sword. You will be richly rewarded if you suceed, but many dangers lie in your path.....

<a name="q1">
<U>What are roguelikes ?</U><BR><BR>
Roguelikes are single-user, fantasy role-playing computer games, generally set in a dungeon, run with a simple character-graphic interface. In all of the games, the player controls a single character, who roams around getting more powerful, in order to fulfill a difficult quest. Sword-and-sorcery rule the day. Logistically, they're all free games; executables, and generally sources, are available by FTP.
