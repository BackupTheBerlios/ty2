R:Human
F:r_human.txt
D:Humans act as a baseline race -- All other races are compared to them. 
D:Humans can choose any class and are average at everything. Humans tend to 
D:go up levels faster than most other races because of their shorter life 
D:spans. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing 
D:human.

R:Hobbit
F:r_hobbit.txt
D:Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have good 
D:saving throws. They also are very good at searching, disarming, perception,
D:and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to be called 
D:burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting.
D:Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a 
D:distance. Hobbits can choose between being a warrior, mage, or rogue. 
D:They have their dexterity sustained and in time they learn to cook a 
D:delicious meal from available ingredients.

R:Dwarf
F:r_dwarf.txt
D:Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Since dungeons 
D:are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior 
D:or priest. Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less 
D:intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat 
D:wise, they resist spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have very 
D:good infra-vision because they live underground. They do have one big 
D:drawback, though. Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud 
D:voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, and screaming out 
D:challenges at nearby foes. In other words, dwarves have a miserable 
D:stealth. They can never be blinded and learn to study the vibrations of 
D:the earth, feeling the layout of a dungeon.

R:High Elf
F:r_helf.txt
D:High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of time.
D:They are masters of all skills, and are strong and intelligent, although 
D:their wisdom is sometimes suspect. They can play all classes except 
D:Paladin, and very well at that. High-elves begin their lives able to see 
D:the unseen, and resist light effects just like regular elves. However, 
D:there are few things that they have not seen already, and experience is 
D:very hard for them to gain.

R:Wood Elf
F:r_welf.txt
D:The first love of Wood Elves is hunting. As such, their skill with the bow
D:is unparalleled. They train tirelessly with their bows, to the point of 
D:neglecting even melee skills. They resist light as with other elves, and 
D:do extra damage with a ranged weapon. They are almost custom made for the 
D:archer class, but also make interesting warriors and rogues. Even Wood Elf
D:Mages are feasible, using the bow to attack and saving their magic for 
D:defense.

R:Dark Elf
F:r_delf.txt
D:Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by darkness attacks,
D:the Dark Elves have a long tradition and knowledge of magic. With their 
D:intelligence they can become superb mages or priests, and they have an 
D:inherent magic missile attack available to them at a low level. With their
D:keen sight, they also learn to see invisible things as their relatives 
D:High-Elves do, but at a higher level.

R:Gnome
F:r_gnome.txt
D:Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like the 
D:hobbits, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent 
D:mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching, 
D:disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans 
D:so they are not very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair 
D:infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance. A 
D:gnome may choose between being a warrior, mage, priest, or rogue. Gnomes 
D:are intrinsically protected against paralysis and some slowing effects. At
D:higher levels, Gnomes learn to teleport at will.

R:Orc
F:r_orc.txt
D:Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are terrible at 
D:magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching, 
D:disarming, and perception. Orcs are quite ugly, and tend to pay more 
D:for goods in town. Orcs do make good warriors and rogues, for the 
D:simple reason that Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots of 
D:hit points. Because of their preference to living underground to on the 
D:surface, orcs resist darkness attacks. Quite soon, an orc learns to dispel
D:any fear that may be upon him or her.

R:Goblin
F:r_goblin.txt
D:Goblins are a weak orc race. They love poisoned weapons, and can learn 
D:to throw poisoned darts (of which they carry an unlimited supply). They 
D:are also inherently resistant to poison, and can become adequate fighters,
D:although they are not one of the more powerful races.

R:Troll
F:r_troll.txt
D:Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than any other
D:character race. They are also very stupid and slow. They make great 
D:warriors and iffy priests. They are bad at searching, disarming, 
D:perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that an Orc grimaces in 
D:their presence. They also happen to be fun to play... trolls always 
D:have their strength sustained. At higher levels, Trolls learn to 
D:enter a berserk fury, and regenerate wounds automatically.
