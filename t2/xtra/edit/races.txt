R:Human
F:r_human.txt
D:Humans act as a baseline race -- All other races are compared to them. 
D:Humans can choose any class and are average at everything. Humans tend to 
D:go up levels faster than most other races because of their shorter life 
D:spans. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing 
D:human.

R:Hobbit
F:r_hobbit.txt
D:Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have good 
D:saving throws. They also are very good at searching, disarming, perception,
D:and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to be called 
D:burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting.
D:Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a 
D:distance. Hobbits can choose between being a warrior, mage, or rogue. 
D:They have their dexterity sustained and in time they learn to cook a 
D:delicious meal from available ingredients.

R:Dwarf
F:r_dwarf.txt
D:Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Dwarves tend
D:to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than humans.
D:Because they distrust magic, they are not good at it, but they also resist
D:very well. They can never be blinded and learn to study the vibrations of 
D:the earth, feeling the layout of a dungeon.

R:High Elf
F:r_helf.txt
D:High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of time.
D:They are masters of all skills, and are strong and intelligent, although 
D:their wisdom is sometimes suspect. High-elves begin their lives able to see 
D:the unseen, and resist light effects.

R:Wood Elf
F:r_welf.txt
D:The first love of Wood Elves is hunting. As such, their skill with the bow
D:is unparalleled. This comes at the cost of their melee skills.They resist
D:light and do extra damage with ranged weapons. They also known for being
D:pickpockets and their ease with magic.

R:Dark Elf
F:r_delf.txt
D:Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by darkness attacks,
D:the Dark Elves have a long tradition and knowledge of magic. With their 
D:intelligence they can become superb mages or priests, and they have an 
D:inherent magic missile attack available to them at a low level.

R:Gnome
F:r_gnome.txt
D:Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings. Gnomes make excellent 
D:mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching, 
D:disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans. 
D:Gnomes are intrinsically protected against paralysis and some slowing effects. At
D:higher levels, Gnomes learn to teleport at will.

R:Orc
F:r_orc.txt
D:Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are terrible at 
D:magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching, 
D:disarming, and perception. Orcs are quite ugly, and tend to pay more 
D:for goods in town. Orcs do make good heroes for the dimple reason that Orcs
D:tend to have great constitutions and lots of hit points. They resist darkness
D:attacks and become fearlesss as they become more experienced.

R:Goblin
F:r_goblin.txt
D:Goblins are a weak orc race. They love poisoned weapons, and can learn 
D:to throw poisoned darts (of which they carry an unlimited supply). They 
D:are also inherently resistant to poison, and can become adequate fighters,
D:although they are not one of the more powerful races.

R:Troll
F:r_troll.txt
D:Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than any other
D:character race. They are also very stupid and slow. They make great 
D:warriors and iffy priests. They are bad at searching, disarming, 
D:perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that an Orc grimaces in 
D:their presence. Trolls always have their strength sustained. At higher
D:levels, Trolls learn to enter a berserk fury, and regenerate wounds automatically.
